He observed a high incidence of puerperal fever, commonly known as childbed fever, among new mothers. Through careful investigation, Semmelweis discovered that the fever was often fatal and was more prevalent in the ward where medical students assisted in childbirth after performing autopsies. He hypothesized that 'cadaverous particles' were being transferred to patients by the medical students.\nTo test his hypothesis, Semmelweis introduced a strict handwashing protocol using a chlorinated lime solution for anyone entering the maternity ward. The incidence of puerperal fever dramatically decreased after this practice was implemented, providing strong evidence for his theory.",

    "OZONE": {
      "Context": "The atmosphere is an ocean of air and a precious natural resource for sustaining life on the Earth. Unfortunately, human activities based on national/personal interests are causing harm to this common resource, notably by depleting the fragile ozone layer, which acts as a protective shield for life on the Earth. Ozone molecules consist of three oxygen atoms, as opposed to oxygen molecules which consist of two oxygen atoms. Ozone molecules are exceedingly rare: fewer than ten in every million molecules of air. However, for nearly a billion years, their presence in the atmosphere has played a vital role in safeguarding life on Earth. Depending on where it is located, ozone can either protect or harm life on Earth. The ozone in the troposphere (up to 10 kilometres above the Earth's surface) is 'bad' ozone which can damage lung tissues and plants. But about 90 percent of ozone found in the stratosphere (between 10 and 40 kilometres above the Earth's surface) is 'good' ozone which plays a beneficial role by absorbing dangerous ultraviolet (UV-B) radiation from the Sun. Without this beneficial ozone layer, humans would be more susceptible to certain diseases due to the increased incidence of ultra-violet rays from the Sun. In the last decades the amount of ozone has decreased. In 1974 it was hypothesised that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) could be a cause for this. Until 1987, scientific assessment of the cause-effect relationship was not convincing enough to implicate CFCs. However, in September 1987, diplomats from around the world met in Montreal (Canada) and agreed to set sharp limits to the use of CFCs.",
      "Question": "In the text above nothing is mentioned about the way ozone is formed in the atmosphere. In fact each day some ozone is formed and some other ozone disappears.\nSuppose you have an uncle who tries to understand the meaning of this strip. However, he did not get \nany science education at school and he doesn't understand what the author of the strip is explaining. \nHe knows that there are no little fellows in the atmosphere but he wonders what those little fellows \nin the strip stand for, what those strange notations O, O2 and O3 mean and which processes the strip \nrepresents. He asks you to explain the strip. Assume that your uncle knows:\nthat O is the symbol for oxygen;\nwhat atoms and molecules are.\nWrite an explanation of the comic strip for your uncle.\nIn your explanation, use the words atoms and molecules.",
      "Answer": "The strip represents the formation and breakdown of ozone in the atmosphere. The 'little fellows' symbolize oxygen atoms and molecules. 'O' stands for a single oxygen atom, 'O2' is a molecule made of two oxygen atoms, and 'O3' is an ozone molecule made of three oxygen atoms. The strip shows how oxygen molecules (O2) can be split into individual oxygen atoms (O) by sunlight. These single oxygen atoms can then combine with O2 molecules to form ozone (O3). Ozone can also break down back into O2 and O atoms, showing the continuous cycle of ozone formation and decomposition in the atmosphere.",

But Dolly is not just a simple sheep. She is a clone of another sheep. A clone means: a copy. Cloning means copying 'from a single master copy'. Scientists succeeded in creating a sheep (Dolly) that is identical to a sheep that functioned as a 'master copy'. It was the Scottish scientist Ian Wilmut who designed the 'copying machine' for sheep. He took a very small piece from the udder of an adult sheep (sheep 1). From that small piece he removed the nucleus, then he transferred the nucleus into the egg-cell of another (female) sheep (sheep 2). But first he removed from that egg-cell all the material that would have determined sheep 2 characteristics in a lamb produced from that egg-cell. Ian Wilmut implanted the manipulated egg-cell of sheep 2 into yet another (female) sheep (sheep 3). Sheep 3 became pregnant and had a lamb: Dolly. Some scientists think that within a few years it will be possible to clone people as well. But many governments have already decided to forbid cloning of people by law.",

      "Context": "Living things need energy to survive. The energy that sustains life on the Earth comes from the Sun, which radiates energy into space because it is so hot. A tiny proportion of this energy reaches the Earth. The Earth's atmosphere acts like a protective blanket over the surface of our planet, preventing the variations in temperature that would exist in an airless world. Most of the radiated energy coming from the Sun passes through the Earth's atmosphere. The Earth absorbs some of this energy, and some is reflected back from the Earth's surface. Part of this reflected energy is absorbed by the atmosphere. As a result of this the average temperature above the Earth's surface is higher than it would be if there were no atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere has the same effect as a greenhouse, hence the term greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is said to have become more pronounced during the twentieth century. It is a fact that the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere has increased. In newspapers and periodicals the increased carbon dioxide emission is often stated as the main source of the temperature rise in the twentieth century. A student named André becomes interested in the possible relationship between the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and the carbon dioxide emission on the Earth.",

Ferwerda talks about the fact that corn can be used as fuel as well as cattle food. As far as he is concerned, this is the future. Ferwerda points out that corn, in the form of cattle food, is in fact a type of fuel too. Cows eat corn to get energy out of it. But, Ferwerda explains, the sale of corn for fuel instead of for cattle food might be much more profitable for farmers. Ferwerda has become convinced that, in the long run, corn will be widely used as fuel. He imagines what it will be like harvesting, storing, drying and packing the grains in bags for sale. Ferwerda is currently investigating whether the whole corn plant could be used as fuel, but this research has not been completed yet. What Ferwerda also needs to consider is the amount of attention being focused on carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is regarded as the main cause of the increase of the Greenhouse effect. The increase of the Greenhouse effect is said to be the cause of the increasing average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. In Ferwerda's view, however, there is nothing wrong with carbon dioxide. On the contrary, he argues, plants absorb it and convert it into oxygen for human beings.

    "TRANSIT OF VENUS": {
      "Context": "On 8 June 2004, the planet Venus could be seen passing in front of the Sun when viewed from many places on Earth. This is called a 'transit' of Venus and happens when its orbit takes Venus between the Sun and Earth. The previous transit of Venus occurred in 1882 and another is predicted to occur in 2012. Below is a picture of the transit of Venus in 2004. A telescope was pointed at the Sun and the image projected onto a white card.",
      "Question": "Why was the transit observed by projecting the image onto a white card, rather than by looking directly through the telescope? A. The Sun's light was too bright for Venus to show up. B. The Sun is big enough to see without magnification. C. Viewing the Sun through a telescope may damage your eyes. D. The image needed to be made smaller by projecting it onto a card.",

    "HEALTH RISK": {
      "Context": "Imagine that you live near a large chemical factory that produces fertilisers for use in agriculture. In recent years there have been several cases of people in the area suffering from long-term breathing problems. Many local people believe that these symptoms are caused by the emission of toxic fumes from the nearby chemical fertiliser factory. A public meeting was held to discuss the potential dangers of the chemical factory to the health of local residents. Scientists made the following statements at the meeting. Statement by scientists working for the chemical company 'We have made a study of the toxicity of soil in the local area. We have found no evidence of toxic chemicals in the samples we have taken.' Statement by scientists working for concerned citizens in the local community 'We have looked at the number of cases of long-term breathing problems in the local area and compared this with the number of cases in an area far away from the chemical factory. There are more incidents in the area close to the chemical factory.'",
      "Question": "The scientists working for the concerned citizens compared the number of people with long-term breathing problems close to the chemical factory with those in an area far away from the factory. Describe one possible difference in the two areas that would make you think that the comparison was not a valid one.",
      "Answer": "One possible difference could be that the area close to the chemical factory has a higher population density than the area far away, which could naturally lead to more cases of breathing problems regardless of the factory's influence.",

    "WIND FARMS": {
      "Context": "Many people believe that wind should replace oil and coal as a source of energy for producing electricity. The structures in the picture are windmills with blades that are rotated by the wind. These rotations cause electricity to be produced by generators that are turned by the windmills.",
      "Question": "The higher the altitude the more slowly windmills rotate at the same wind speed. Which one of the following is the best reason why the blades of windmills rotate more slowly in higher places at the same wind speed? A. The air is less dense as altitude increases. B. The temperature is lower as altitude increases. C. Gravity becomes less as altitude increases. D. It rains more often as altitude increases.",
