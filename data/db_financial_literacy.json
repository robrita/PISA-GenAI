    "topic": "Antibiotics and resistance",
    "context": "Antibiotics are medications used to treat bacterial infections. They work by killing bacteria or preventing them from reproducing. However, overuse and misuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, where bacteria evolve to resist the effects of these medications.",
    "question": "Why is it important to complete a prescribed course of antibiotics?",
    "answer": "Completing a prescribed course of antibiotics ensures that all the bacteria are killed, reducing the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant bacteria."

    "topic": "Earth's atmosphere",
    "context": "The Earth\u2019s atmosphere is composed of several layers, each with distinct characteristics. The troposphere is the lowest layer, where weather occurs and where most of the atmospheric mass is found. Above the troposphere is the stratosphere, which contains the ozone layer that absorbs and scatters ultraviolet solar radiation.",
    "question": "What is the primary function of the ozone layer in the stratosphere?",
    "answer": "The primary function of the ozone layer is to absorb and scatter ultraviolet solar radiation."

    "topic": "Atmospheric layers and temperature changes",
    "context": "The Earth's atmosphere is composed of several layers, each with distinct characteristics. The troposphere is the lowest layer, where most of the Earth's weather occurs. As altitude increases, the temperature generally decreases in the troposphere, but this trend reverses in the stratosphere, where the temperature begins to increase.",
    "question": "Why does the temperature increase in the stratosphere despite increasing altitude?",
    "answer": "The temperature increases in the stratosphere due to the absorption of ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer."

    "topic": "Photosynthesis and its importance",
    "context": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. This process converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, using light as an energy source.",
    "question": "Why is photosynthesis important for life on Earth?",
    "answer": "Photosynthesis is important because it produces oxygen and is the source of energy for most living organisms."
